We can now save our processed microdata and time series datasets.

We begin by creating the workspace into which we will save our processed datasets.

```{r}
# write_ws_fn(path_to_private_1L_chr, processed_dir_1L_chr = processed_dir_1L_chr)
```

We save a copy of our processed dataset.

```{r message=FALSE}
saveRDS(processed_ls, paste0(path_to_private_1L_chr,"/",processed_dir_1L_chr, "/R/processed_ls.RDS"))
```
